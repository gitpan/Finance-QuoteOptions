	- Looks like the CBOE *does* blacklist IPs that pull too
	much data. Warning added to documentation.

	- Added code to the CBOE section that will calculate the
	expiration date from the month and year if the detail page
	is unavailable. This was because I was blacklisted in two
	steps, first the detail page on a Friday, then the main page
	on a Monday. I was hoping that the blacklist would happen
	only on the detail page. Alas.

	- Query code now returns immediately if first HTTP retrieval
	fails. Fixes occasional query hang.
	- Documentation fixes.
