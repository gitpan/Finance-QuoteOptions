Finance-QuoteOptions version 0.23
=================================

A 'screen-scraper' utility that extracts options pricing and series
information from the web.

This uses either Yahoo Finance or the CBOE web site
for information. The CBOE probably has better data but Yahoo is
much faster. By default Yahoo will be used as the data source.

Be sure to read the documentation regarding CBOE blacklisting.
